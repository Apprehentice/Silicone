-- A key-controlled event-based user interface for LÃ–VE.
--
-- Silicone is a user interface system designed for the
-- controller. It uses named elements and a serializable
-- Lua table based menu declaration style that allows you
-- to quickly create menus based on structure prototypes,
-- helping to separate layout and style from function.
--
-- For usage, see @{Root}.
